# SCPContainmentBreach
A remake of the classic "SCP Containment Breach" game, originally programming in Blitz, rewritten in C++. just making this for fun


# How to compile/build
you need to download 'glew-2.1.0', extact the zip and create a folder in your C: drive called OpenGL and place glew in that folder, so you should jave bin, doc, include and lib in the 'glew-2.1.0' folder (path to lib being 'C:\OpenGL\glew-2.1.0\lib')
you can change this folder if you want to by editing the project options and stuff.
